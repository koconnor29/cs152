How to compile:
---------------

  If you have make installed, you can simply type "make" at the
  command line. Otherwise, if you are on a Windows machine, you can
  edit the make.bat file to point to your installation of Ocaml, and
  execute the make.bat file. If neither of these methods work, you
  should execute the commands listed in the make.bat file.

  Successful compilation will produce an executable file called "lam".
